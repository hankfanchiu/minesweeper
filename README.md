# Minesweeper Game

## A simple CLI minesweeper game

Choosing an unrevealed tile (assuming not bombed) would trigger one of the two following events:

1. If none of the selected tile's neighbors are bombed, then each of the neighboring tiles would be revealed, causing a chain reaction.

2. If at least one of the select tile's neighbors is a bombed, then only the select tile would be revealed, showing the number of bombed tiles that neighbor this select tile.
